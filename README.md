# 8 Queens

A small program I found in my old school work that was done for bonus points in Data Structures. This program will attempt to find every solution to the 8 Queens problem using recursion when given a starting position for the first queen. It will also timestamp how long it takes to solve the problem for the given starting point. 

### Running

This is a C++ program, so g++ will be required.

`g++ main.cpp -o queens`
`./queens` 

Follow the directions and enjoy! Feel free to use it yourself for some bonus points.
